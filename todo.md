- Find meson command line option to put install prefix in environment variable
- // look at ADTs again - linked list generic ADT?
// make ADT struct of value, next where value is a pointer to the details of the
// User / blockedUser?
- BlockedUsersList: make the rwlock write preferred

### Potential improvements
- BlockedUsersList: could be improved with some data structure sorted by blockee name
- BlockedUsersList: checkBlocked: keep sorted list (or something more fancy???) of blockees and do binary search?
- generic ADT for messageList, blockedUsersList?. Clients also very similar to blockedUsers
